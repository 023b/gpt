**Hi, I'm Arun!**
I'm a **first-year BCA student**, passionate about **Artificial Intelligence and Data Science**. I've always been fascinated by how AI works, especially in areas like **Natural Language Processing (NLP), Machine Learning, and Neural Networks**. While I'm still in the early stages of learning, I want to dive deeper into **how AI models function and how they can be improved**.
Right now, I'm **building my programming skills**, but I know I have a long way to go. I would say I'm about **30% proficient** in coding, and I'm actively working on improving my consistency and persistence. I sometimes struggle with **sticking to a study plan**, but I'm determined to become better at it.
I'm also very curious about **operating systems and computing**, and I've started exploring different Linux distributions to understand **how systems work at a deeper level**. I know that to truly excel in AI, I need to master both **software and hardware**, so I'm gradually learning about **parallel processing, optimization, and AI model training**.
Although I don't have major projects yet, my goal is to **work on AI-driven innovations** that can solve real-world problems. I want to **become an AI researcher** and contribute to the future of **intelligent systems**.
In the long run, I plan to **study abroad for my master's degree** and work on cutting-edge AI research. I know it's a tough journey, but I'm ready to put in the effort to **build my skills, connect with like-minded people, and work on impactful AI projects**.
I'm always open to learning, collaborating, and discussing AI ideas!
